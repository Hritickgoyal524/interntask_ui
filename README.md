Flutter UI 

## Getting Started

For creating this UI I have used basic flutter widgets.Can divided whole ui in 4 parts.
First of all I have used columnwidget so that other widget can arrange vertically.
1. we have used one container that have row widget as its child and row conatiner other diffrent widgets such as icon widget ,Text widget.
2. After giving some amount of space by using sizedBox widget we have used a container widget that contain image as a child.
3. I have used Row widget that contain 4 column widgets as its childern and each column widget conatin 2 Text widget as their children.
4. I have used 3 column widgets that have list tile widget as its children.Futhur in list tile I have used title for highlighted text ,subtitle for weight and trailing for calory value.
